MODULAR BANKING DEMO - CIRCULAR PANES IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
==========================================================

Step 1: Implement a failing test for the new circular panes on the dashboard
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a test that checks for the presence of two new circular elements on the dashboard:
- One labeled "Modular Architecture" on the left side of the deposits section
- Another labeled "Supporting Services" on the right side of the four existing modules
- Verify elements are present, correctly positioned, and have expected labels
- Include assertions to check clicking opens corresponding information panes
- Ensure test fails initially as functionality is not implemented yet

Step 2: Add the circular panes to the dashboard layout
-----------------------------------------------------
Modify the dashboard component to include two new circular elements:
- Position "Modular Architecture" pane to the left of deposits section
- Position "Supporting Services" pane to the right of existing four modules
- Use flexbox or grid layout to maintain existing layout integrity
- Apply Temenos color palette (#5CB8B2, #8246AF, #283275) for styling
- Ensure visual integration with existing design
- Maintain sufficient contrast for accessibility
- Implement responsive design for different screen sizes

Step 3: Implement the click functionality for the new circular panes
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Create event listeners for the new panes:
- Trigger opening of respective information panes when clicked
- Ensure behavior consistency with existing dashboard elements
- Use ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation for accessibility
- Apply subtle animations for visual feedback
- Adhere to performance feedback requirements
- Test click functionality across different devices and browsers

Step 4: Develop the content and layout for the information panes
---------------------------------------------------------------
Create new components for information panes:
- "Modular Architecture" information pane component
- "Supporting Services" information pane component
- Structure content to be clear, concise, and aligned with Temenos voice
- Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA roles for accessibility
- Implement responsive layout for various screen sizes
- Apply Temenos color palette and typography consistently
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability
- Include mechanisms for users to close or navigate back

Step 5: Enhance error handling and user feedback
-----------------------------------------------
Implement comprehensive error handling:
- Handle scenarios where new panes or content fail to load
- Display user-friendly error messages with clear next steps
- Add loading indicators or skeleton screens for visual feedback
- Gracefully handle network failures or data retrieval issues
- Maintain smooth user experience during errors
- Implement logging for errors to facilitate debugging

Step 6: Optimize performance and responsiveness
----------------------------------------------
Implement performance optimizations:
- Lazy loading for information pane content to improve load times
- Efficient DOM manipulation for opening/closing panes
- Minimize layout shifts and ensure smooth animations
- Optimize images/assets using modern formats like WebP
- Implement caching strategies for content
- Reduce server load and improve response times
- Conduct performance testing, especially on mobile devices

Step 7: Conduct comprehensive testing and refinement
---------------------------------------------------
Expand testing coverage:
