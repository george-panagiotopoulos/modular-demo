# JOLT Spec Generator Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Create Failing Test
Create a failing test for the new "JOLT spec generator" feature in the UI. Write a test that checks for the presence of a new button labeled "JOLT spec generator" in the left menu, positioned below the "transformer" button. The test should also verify that clicking this button reveals a new section with the title "JOLT specification generator", instructions for the user, and a "Generate JOLT" button. Ensure the test fails initially, as the feature has not been implemented yet.

## Step 2: Implement UI Changes
Implement the UI changes for the new "JOLT spec generator" feature. Add a new button to the left menu, labeled "JOLT spec generator", and position it below the existing "transformer" button. Create a new section that appears when this button is clicked, following the same layout as the transformer section. Include a title "JOLT specification generator", user instructions stating "Provide input JSON and target output JSON then press Generate JOLT", and a button labeled "Generate JOLT". Apply the Temenos color template (#5CB8B2, #8246AF, #283275) to maintain visual consistency with the existing UI. Ensure that the new UI elements are responsive and accessible.

## Step 3: Refactor for Maintainability
Refactor the existing code to improve maintainability and adhere to clean code principles. Extract the common layout structure shared between the transformer and JOLT spec generator sections into a reusable component. Use descriptive names for variables and functions, following the established naming conventions in the codebase. Separate the UI logic from the data management to maintain a clear separation of concerns. Remove any duplicated code that may have been introduced during the initial implementation.

## Step 4: Enhance User Experience
Enhance the user experience by adding smooth transitions when switching between the transformer and JOLT spec generator sections. Implement proper state management to ensure that the correct section is displayed based on the selected left menu button. Use appropriate React hooks or state management solutions to handle the UI state changes efficiently. Ensure that the UI remains responsive and performant, even with the addition of the new feature.

## Step 5: Error Handling and Validation
Implement proper error handling and input validation for the new JOLT spec generator feature. Add client-side validation to ensure that the input JSON and target output JSON fields are not empty before enabling the "Generate JOLT" button. Display user-friendly error messages using the Temenos color template when validation fails. Implement proper focus management to improve accessibility, ensuring that users can navigate the new UI elements using keyboard controls.

## Step 6: Testing
Write additional unit tests to cover the new UI components and interactions. Test the behavior of the "JOLT spec generator" button, the display of the new section, and the presence of all required elements (title, instructions, and "Generate JOLT" button). Implement integration tests to ensure that the new feature works correctly within the context of the entire application. Update existing tests if necessary to accommodate any changes made during the implementation of the new feature.

## Step 7: Final Review
Conduct a final review of the implementation, focusing on code quality, adherence to the specified requirements, and consistency with the existing codebase. Ensure that all naming conventions are followed, the code is properly documented, and the UI adheres to the Temenos color template. Verify that the feature meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including clean code principles, language idioms, and separation of concerns. Make any necessary adjustments before considering the feature complete.
