# MobileApp Component Redesign Implementation Plan

## Step 1: Implement Failing Tests
- Create test file for MobileApp component
- Test for presence of key UI elements (navigation, content areas, forms)
- Test for proper Temenos color usage (#5CB8B2, #8246AF, #283275)
- Test responsive layout across different screen sizes
- Test accessibility features (ARIA roles, semantic HTML)
- Test keyboard navigation and focus management

## Step 2: Create New MobileApp Component Structure
- Implement semantic HTML structure with proper ARIA roles
- Create mobile-first responsive design using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Apply Temenos Color Template consistently
- Implement proper heading hierarchy and landmarks
- Add skip navigation links for accessibility

## Step 3: Develop Reusable UI Components
- Create accessible button components with proper focus states
- Implement form input components with validation
- Design navigation menu with keyboard support
- Add loading indicators and skeleton screens
- Implement subtle animations for user feedback
- Ensure proper color contrast ratios

## Step 4: Implement Error Handling and User Feedback
- Create clear error message components
- Implement form validation with contextual tips
- Add autosave functionality for forms
- Implement loading states and progress indicators
- Create toast notifications for user feedback

## Step 5: Apply Gestalt Principles
- Group related elements using proximity and similarity
- Create clear visual hierarchy with typography
- Implement effective whitespace usage
- Use consistent iconography and visual elements
- Balance professionalism with approachability

## Step 6: Enhance Trust and Credibility
- Add security indicators and privacy notices
- Implement predictable user behaviors
- Create confirmation steps for critical operations
- Add tooltips and guided onboarding
- Provide transparent data usage information

## Step 7: Comprehensive Testing
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for user workflows
- End-to-end tests for complete scenarios
- Accessibility testing with assistive technologies
- Cross-device and cross-browser testing
- Performance testing and optimization

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass successfully
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance achieved
- Responsive design works across all target devices
- Temenos branding applied consistently
- Performance metrics meet requirements
- User experience is intuitive and accessible
